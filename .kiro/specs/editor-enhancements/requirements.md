# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the EditorLayer with two key functionalities: a pause/play control system for game simulation and a component attachment system in the Inspector panel. The pause system allows developers to control the execution of game logic during development, while the component attachment system provides a visual interface for adding and managing ECS components and C++ script components on selected entities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want a pause/play button in the editor UI, so that I can control when game logic and scripts execute during development and debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the editor starts THEN the system SHALL display a pause/play button in the ImGui interface
2. WHEN the pause button is clicked THEN the system SHALL set a `running` boolean variable to false
3. WHEN the play button is clicked THEN the system SHALL set the `running` boolean variable to true
4. WHEN `running` is false THEN the system SHALL skip execution of NativeScriptableComponent OnUpdate calls
5. WHEN `running` is false THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator showing the paused state
6. WHEN `running` is true THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator showing the playing state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to add components to selected entities through the Inspector panel, so that I can visually configure entity behavior without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an entity is selected in the Hierarchy THEN the Inspector SHALL display an "Add Component" button
2. WHEN the "Add Component" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL show a dropdown or menu of available component types
3. WHEN a component type is selected from the menu THEN the system SHALL add that component to the selected entity
4. WHEN a component is added THEN the Inspector SHALL immediately display the component's properties for editing
5. IF the selected entity already has the component type THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate addition or show an appropriate message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to attach C++ script components to entities through the Inspector, so that I can add custom behavior scripts visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component menu is displayed THEN it SHALL include available ScriptableEntity-derived classes
2. WHEN a script component is selected THEN the system SHALL create a NativeScriptableComponent with the appropriate script binding
3. WHEN a script component is added THEN the Inspector SHALL display the script name and basic information
4. WHEN multiple script types are available THEN the system SHALL list all classes derived from ScriptableEntity
5. IF a script component already exists on the entity THEN the system SHALL show replacement options because WE DON'T Have multiple Scripts support yet.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to see and edit component properties in the Inspector panel, so that I can configure entity behavior through a visual interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an entity with components is selected THEN the Inspector SHALL display all attached components
2. WHEN displaying components THEN the system SHALL show component names and types but not detailed properties (no reflection system yet)
3. WHEN an entity has a TransformComponent THEN the Inspector SHALL display editable Transform properties (Translation, Rotation, Scale)
4. WHEN a component can be removed THEN the Inspector SHALL provide a remove button for each component
5. WHEN a component is removed THEN the system SHALL properly clean up the component and update the display

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to see all entities in the scene through the Hierarchy panel, so that I can easily navigate and select entities for editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Hierarchy panel is displayed THEN it SHALL show all entities currently in the scene
2. WHEN an entity has a TagComponent THEN the Hierarchy SHALL display the entity name along with its ID
3. WHEN an entity does not have a TagComponent THEN the Hierarchy SHALL display "Entity [ID]" format
4. WHEN I click on an entity in the Hierarchy THEN it SHALL become the selected entity
5. WHEN an entity is selected THEN it SHALL be highlighted in the Hierarchy panel
6. WHEN I right-click on an entity THEN the system SHALL show a context menu with delete option

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the pause state to persist across editor sessions, so that I don't lose my debugging workflow when restarting the editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the editor starts THEN the system SHALL load the previous pause state from configuration
2. WHEN the pause state changes THEN the system SHALL save the new state to configuration
3. WHEN no previous state exists THEN the system SHALL default to paused state for safety
4. WHEN the editor shuts down THEN the system SHALL persist the current pause state
5. IF configuration loading fails THEN the system SHALL default to paused state and log the error
