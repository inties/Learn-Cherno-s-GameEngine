# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements automatic GPU resource creation and management for ECS components, specifically focusing on RenderComponent lifecycle management. When entities with RenderComponents are created (such as cube prefabs), the system should automatically notify the RendererLayer to create the necessary GPU resources (VAO, materials, shaders) and assign them to the component. This eliminates manual resource management and ensures proper resource lifecycle coupling with component lifecycle.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want cube prefabs to automatically have their GPU resources created when I add a RenderComponent, so that I don't need to manually manage VAO and material creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a RenderComponent is added to an entity THEN the system SHALL automatically create the appropriate VAO and material resources
2. WHEN a cube prefab is created THEN the system SHALL reuse the existing SetupCube code to generate cube geometry
3. WHEN GPU resources are created THEN they SHALL be properly assigned to the RenderComponent's VAO and Mat fields
4. WHEN multiple cube entities are created THEN they SHALL share the same VAO resource for efficiency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an engine developer, I want a component lifecycle notification system, so that different systems can respond to component addition and removal events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component is added to an entity THEN the system SHALL trigger an OnComponentAdded callback
2. WHEN a component is removed from an entity THEN the system SHALL trigger an OnComponentRemoved callback
3. WHEN the RendererLayer receives a RenderComponent addition notification THEN it SHALL create the appropriate GPU resources
4. IF the RendererLayer is not available THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want automatic resource cleanup when entities are destroyed, so that I don't have memory leaks or GPU resource leaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an entity with a RenderComponent is destroyed THEN the system SHALL properly release associated GPU resources
2. WHEN shared resources are used by multiple entities THEN the system SHALL use reference counting to prevent premature cleanup
3. WHEN the last entity using a shared resource is destroyed THEN the system SHALL release the shared resource
4. IF resource cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL log an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an engine developer, I want the Scene class to coordinate between ECS and rendering systems, so that component lifecycle events are properly communicated to the RendererLayer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Scene creates an entity with RenderComponent THEN it SHALL notify the RendererLayer through a well-defined interface
2. WHEN Scene has access to RendererLayer THEN it SHALL use dependency injection or service locator pattern
3. WHEN the notification system is used THEN it SHALL support different component types beyond just RenderComponent
4. IF RendererLayer is not available during Scene operations THEN the system SHALL defer resource creation until RendererLayer becomes available
