# GameEngine Product Overview

## Project Description
A C++ game engine project following Cherno's GameEngine tutorial series. This is a learning-focused implementation of a modern game engine architecture with OpenGL rendering, ECS (Entity-Component-System) design patterns, and cross-platform support.

## Key Features
- **Rendering System**: OpenGL-based renderer with abstraction layers for future graphics API support
- **ECS Architecture**: Entity-Component-System pattern using EnTT library for flexible game object management  
- **Scene Management**: Hierarchical scene system with transform components and entity relationships
- **Asset Pipeline**: Model loading with Assimp, texture management, and shader compilation
- **Platform Abstraction**: Windows-focused with cross-platform design considerations

## Project Goals
- Educational implementation of game engine concepts
- Modern C++17 architecture with clean abstractions
- Performance-oriented design with data-driven approaches
- Extensible framework for future graphics and gameplay features

## Target Audience
- Learning project for game engine development concepts
- Foundation for building simple 3D applications and games
- Reference implementation for modern C++ game engine patterns
